# üåê Fundamentals of Low-Code  
LightCode Erasmus+ Project  
Universit√© Paris Dauphine ‚Äì PSL  

---

## Why Low-Code?  

- Rising demand for digital applications  
- Shortage of skilled developers  
- Need for agility and speed  
- Democratization of software creation  

---

## Learning Outcomes  

By the end, you will be able to:  
1. Explain the evolution leading to low-code platforms  
2. Define low-code development and its key traits  
3. Identify core components of low-code platforms  
4. Recognize benefits: speed, cost reduction, accessibility  
5. Apply design principles (Design Thinking, MDD, Agile)  
6. Describe the anatomy of a low-code application  
7. Understand deployment, scalability, maintenance  

---

## What is Low-Code?  

- Visual interactive interfaces  
- Reusable components  
- Automatic code generation  
- Visual modeling tools  

üëâ Faster delivery, reduced complexity, broader access  

---

## Core Components  

1. Visual Development Interfaces  
2. Pre-built Functions & Templates  
3. Automation & Workflow Tools  
4. Integration Capabilities (APIs, connectors)  

---

## Principles of Low-Code  

- **Design Thinking**: empathize, prototype, test  
- **Model-Driven Development (MDD)**: models before code  
- **Agile Integration**: incremental, collaborative, adaptive  

---

## Anatomy of a Low-Code App  

- **UI Design**: responsive, accessible, component-based  
- **Data Modeling**: visual, external integration, logic  
- **Business Logic**: workflows, conditional rules, validation  
- **Integration**: APIs, connectors, custom options  
- **Deployment**: one-click, scalable, cloud-native  

---

## Challenges  

- Over-reliance on custom code  
- Weak UX design if rushed  
- Complexity in large apps  
- Integration issues with legacy systems  

---

## Best Practices  

- Start with clear requirements + design thinking  
- Fully leverage platform capabilities  
- Plan for scalability early  
- Adopt Agile practices  
- Invest in training & governance  
- Continuous testing and refactoring  

---

## Case Studies  

**Education** üéì  
- Student/faculty portals, streamlined workflows  

**Small Businesses** üè™  
- CRM, inventory, e-commerce apps  

**Non-Profits** üå±  
- Volunteer mgmt, donations, outreach tools  

---

## Conceptual Activities  

- Design a low-code solution for a non-profit  
- Evaluate a platform (features, scalability, integration)  
- Discuss future trends (AI, citizen developers)  
- Address challenges with best practices  

---

# ‚ú® Conclusion  

Low-code is:  
- Accessible  
- Fast  
- Scalable  
- Innovative  

**It reshapes software development and opens horizons.**
